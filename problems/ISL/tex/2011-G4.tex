\begin{statement}{2011 G4}
	Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$. Let $B_0$ be the midpoint of $AC$ and let $C_0$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ and let $G$ be the centroid of the triangle $ABC$. Let $\omega$ be a circle through $B_0$ and $C_0$ that is tangent to the circle $\Omega$ at a point $X\not= A$. Prove that the points $D,G$ and $X$ are collinear.
\end{statement}
We use directed angles $\mod180^\circ$. Let $Y$ be the point on $\omega$ such that $\seg{AY}\parallel\seg{BC}$, $A_0$ be the midpoint of $\seg{BC}$, $T$ be the $A_0-$altitude of $\triangle A_0B_0C_0$, and $X'$ be the second intersection of $\seg{YD}$ with $\omega$. Considering a homothety with center $G$ and ratio $-\frac12$, $(ABC)$ is taken to the nine-point circle of $\triangle ABC$, so the image of $Y$ must be the intersection of $\seg{BC}$ and the nine-point circle that is not $A_0$. Thus, $Y-G-D$. Thus, it suffices to show $(X'B_0C_0)$ is tangent to $(ABC)$. \\
Again by the homothety with center $G$, note that $D$ maps to $T$, so $D-G-T$. Now, we have
\[ \dang C_0TX'= \dang AYX' = \dang ABX' = \dang C_0BX', \]
so $C_OTX'B$ is cyclic. Analogously, $B_0TX'C$ is cyclic. Thus, 
\[ \dang C_0X'B=\dang C_0TB = 90^\circ-\dang BTA_0 = 90^\circ-\dang A_0TC = \dang CTB_0 = \dang CX'B_0. \]
Let $P$ and $Q$ be the second intersections of $\seg{X'C_0}$ and $\seg{X'B_0}$ with $\omega$. The last angle equality implies that $PQCB$ is an isosceles trapezoid, giving $\seg{B_0C_0}\parallel\seg{QP}$. Thus, there is a homothety centered at $X'$ taking $(X'B_0C_0)$ to $(ABC)$, implying these circles are tangent at $X'$, as desired. $\blacksquare$
