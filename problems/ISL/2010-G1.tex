\begin{statement}{2010 G1}
	Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $D, E, F$ the feet of the altitudes lying on $BC, CA, AB$ respectively. One of the intersection points of the line $EF$ and the circumcircle is $P.$ The lines $BP$ and $DF$ meet at point $Q.$ Prove that $AP = AQ$.
\end{statement}
We use directed angles$\mod180^\circ$. From the cyclic quads we have from altitudes,
\[ \dang AFQ = \dang AFD = \dang ACD = \dang ACB = \dang APB = \dang APQ, \]
so $AQPF$ is cyclic. Now, recall $A$ is the $D-$excenter of $\triangle DEF$, so $A$ lies on the exterior angle bisector of $\angle QFP$. Thus, $A$ is the midpoint of $\widehat{PFQ}$ of $(AQPF)$. Hence, $AP=AQ$ as desired. $\blacksquare$
